Phase 1: Initialize the Monorepo

First, run the Turborepo starter command. This creates the "workspace" that manages everything.

 - npx create-turbo@latest ePRX_UV1-monorepo
 - pnpm
 
Phase 2: The ePRX V3 Architecture

Once created, your structure should look like this. You will move your existing code into these folders:
 
 1. The Apps (Targets)

    apps/web: Your existing Next.js project.

    apps/api: Your existing NestJS project.

    apps/mobile: A new Expo project.

2. The Packages (Shared Logic)

    packages/api-client: Shared Axios/TanStack Query hooks (so handleUpdate is written once).

    packages/types: Shared TypeScript interfaces (e.g., User, UploadResponse).

    packages/ui: Shared design tokens (colors, spacing).
	
Phase 3: Creating the Mobile App (Expo)

Inside the apps folder, initialize your mobile application:

 - cd apps
 - npx create-expo-app mobile --template tabs-navigation
 
 To make mobile development feel like your web development, I recommend adding NativeWind so you can use Tailwind CSS on both platforms.
 
Phase 4: Sharing the "Profile Sync" Logic

This is where the magic happens. Remember the handleUpdate function we fixed? Instead of writing it in React and then again in React Native, we create a shared hook.

1. Create packages/api-client/index.ts:

Phase 5: Running Everything

The beauty of Turborepo is the single command to start the entire ePRX V3 ecosystem:

# In the root folder
 - pnpm dev

 Note: change interface to class from packages/type/src/index.ts
        or add type on imports
        set IsolatedModule = false
